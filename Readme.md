# Homecast
## Introduction
Homecast is a React Native app designed for people looking for a flat. It allows them to join virtual open houses through an ios and android app. It effectively removes the first visit which more often than is just a waste of time.

## How it works
### Estate agents
- Sign up to the app
- Create viewings (uploading all details and images)
- Create open house meetings
- Connect to the open house and start streaming with their phone camera

### Viewers
- Sign up to the app
- Find the flat they like
- Join a live viewing
- Ask questions through the chat


## Tech
- Apart from the usual backend servers the app uses a custom WebRTC server to stream videos in a one to many broadcast solution
